# change_brightness
change brightness of connected monitor on xfce desktop environment
 
This programme is made because i keep needing to type in 
"xrandr --output HDMI-A-1 --brightness 0.5"
to change my monitor's brightness, so i wanted to make a GUI to do that for me

im new to linux, arch linux btw and xfce. i want a way to change my 
monitor's brightness without using the terminal so that
1) its easier for me
2) its easier if my family member wants to use the pc

I made this programme on 24 & 25 Dec 2025
